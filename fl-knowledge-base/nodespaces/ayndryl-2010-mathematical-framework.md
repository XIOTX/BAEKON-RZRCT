## Core Mathematical Framework

### The Ising Model Application
"Eddag-1240 and Elyam-2200 are not programs. They are the label that we assign to the output, once the system reaches a stable minimum. The system we are developing is called 'Nodespaces', and it is coupled to a statistical mechanical program called 'Vectorial'. What they do is implementing the Ising model, and all-time classic of statistical mechanical modelling. Originally, it was proposed to explain ferromagnetism, but the model is so powerful that it has over the years been adapted and applied to the study of a variety of phenomena, including language contact and language drift."

### Dynamical System Structure
"'Vectorial' is a dynamical system, that is, a rule that given one point in a state space, it tells us where it is going to be a unit of time later. The basic mathematical model is thus a manifold M, a map f:M-->M and a function s:M-->R. Now, M represents all the possible states of the system, while f represents the time evolution, a rule that determines what is the state one unit of time later."

### Critical Exponents and Beta Values
"The partition function is controlled by a so-called critical exponent (beta). The numbers 1240 and 2200 means that we ran the system for beta=2.2 and beta=1.240. Note that a small change in the critical exponent yields a totally different language for the same input."

### Attractor States
"For many practical cases, after some time the system converges to a subset of M of low dimension, usually called the 'attractor'. As you know, it is imposible to find the original seed state S(0) of a Markov process given the final state S(f) by virtue of the stochastic nature of the process. But it might be of interest to you that, regardless of the initial state (that is, language) you arrive at quite stable (and beautiful) consistent configurations (like Eddag-1240 or Elyam-2200)."

## Language Evolution Theory

### Welsh Evolution Example
"Your question on how are they connected with language can now be answered: as we have records of, say, Old Welsh, Middle Welsh, and Modern Welsh, then we have a traceable history of how Welsh changed. This is our Welsh manifold M. The rules defining each state is given, roughly, by linguists (phonology rules, consonantal conservation, pallatization, etc.). Therefore, you can code the system to apply those rules to Modern Welsh and see what comes out."

### Weddag-2075 Case Study
"The language you thought to be Welsh is called Weddag-2075: we fed the system with Welsh, supressed the Normand contribution, added some Goidelic patterns, and left the system evolve assigning specific value to the Beta exponent of an Ising system to see what happens. Beta = 2.075 in this particular scenario."

### Alashi-1330 Characteristics
"The language called Alashi-1330 is a semitic one with bi-radical nouns and IE SVO typology with a Lyapunov exponent of 1.33."

## Cultural-Linguistic Theory

### The "Feeling Russian" Concept
"Russian speakers have the words 'dusa' and 'sud'ba', for which no translation exists in English. Translating them into 'soul' and 'fate' is just a rough approximation. Only a native speaker of Russian can fully grasp the meaning of 'dusa'. Only a native speaker of Hebrew can grasp the full meaning of 'memrah' or 'ruach'. Only a native speaker of Lakota can fully understand the word 'wakantanga'."

### Language and Reality Shaping
"This means humans are also complex adaptative systems. There are no 'genuine' Russian (or any other language) words. There are genuine Russian (or some other) feelings. This is so because you shape your language to talk about reality and what you feel when facing that reality, but speakers do live in quite different areas on this planet and they experience quite different 'microrealities', therefore it is but normal to see differences in how they perceive reality and, thus, in how they name those experiences."

### Fractal Linguistics
"We are not interested in 'conlangs'. We are interested in fractal linguistics. Finally, the configurations you arrive at are all languages. You can use them as you use your native ones, you can use them to describe reality or write poetry."
