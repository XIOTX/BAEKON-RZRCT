## Quantum Communication Theory

### HAL1 and HAL2 System
"In the communication setting the goal of two separated quantum computers, HAL1 and HAL2, is to compute a joint function f(s,t), where input s ∈ S is known by HAL1 and t ∈ T to HAL2. Assuming both computers are separated by 1060 light years only a one-way communication protocol can be used. After receiving its input s, HAL1 sends a message ms to HAL2 which must then correctly output f(s,t)."

### Universe as Message
"If our Universe is the message being communicated by HAL1 to HAL2, it is obvious that any exact one-way quantum communication protocol must use messages of length log n."

### Photon Perspective
"If the message is sent at the speed of light, from the perspective of the photon, the age of the Universe is zero. Both time and distance is zero and, hence, the message arrives at the moment it is created."

### External Computing Systems
"As the Universe - the message - is expanding at a given velocity of 73.8 km/sec per Megaparsec of distance between any two points, this also means both HAL1 and HAL2 would be separating from each other at that speed. In order for the communication to be achieved, both HAL1 and HAL2 must not belong to this Universe, i.e.: both computers are located outside our Universe."

## Postbiological Signatures

### Communication Signatures
"The signature of a postbiological civilization is always a higher-level correlation of signals and, more specifically, a unique way of entangling information because it is only sharing entangled information that you can communicate from both ends of the Universe"

### Intelligence vs Consciousness
"No matter how intelligent they are, even if we face a postbiological superintelligence threat, one that does not need consciousness at all, there is something they need: they need to communicate. And if they wish to communicate they need to create universes, not destroy them. Furthermore, a superintelligent AI system made by reverse engineering a biological brain and enhancing that brain with powerful algorithms will also be prone to make... supermistakes."

### The Critical Difference
"The main difference between us and them is this: we are conscious beings, while they are just superintelligent non-biological constructs. If we are to clash we need to exploit that difference. And it is a certain fact that we will clash, for consciousness requires a biological substrate, and consciousness is what they need, and what they lack."
