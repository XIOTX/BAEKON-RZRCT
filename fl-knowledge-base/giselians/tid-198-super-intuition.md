## Quantum Consciousness Theory

### Reality Structure
The reality of our world is quantum, that is a set of alternative classical realities coexist in the quantum reality of the world.

### Super-consciousness Access
In principle there can be some way for a person to gain access to 'other' classical realities. According to QCC, this access occurs if the out-of-personal super-consciousness is activated.

### Consciousness States
This may occur when the personal consciousness is turned off, or even in parallel with it.

### Parallel Realities
Discussion of accessing alternative classical realities through quantum consciousness mechanisms.
