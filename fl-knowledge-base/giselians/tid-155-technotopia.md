## Simulation Theory
Simulated worlds (W') replicate real worlds (W) using fewer computations.

## Nested Simulation Risk
If Giselians initiate a simulation of their past but terminate it upon detecting nesting (a simulation within a simulation), they risk self-termination.

## Historical Terminations
Previous Sol-3 simulations were terminated due to catastrophic events or humans discovering their simulated nature.

## Human Descendants Theory
The possibility that Giselians are human descendants running simulations for ethical reasons or to investigate biological evolution.

## Rendlesham Glitch
The Rendlesham Forest incident is hypothesized as a potential glitch in a Giselian simulation.

## Fermi Paradox Solution
Simulating humanity could be a method for extraterrestrial intelligence to address the Fermi paradox.
