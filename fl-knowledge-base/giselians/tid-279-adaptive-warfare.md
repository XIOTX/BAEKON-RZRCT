## Key Intelligence

### System Resilience
Attacked by a large enough force not all systems are fragile, even if attacked over a sufficient period of time. The Giselian system, in particular, is highly robust and shows resilience, though it might be the case we are using the wrong weapons against the wrong targets.

### Adaptive Response Mechanism
We know the capability to adapt allows them for an increase in the effectiveness of a response to our attacks, but this has been shown to occur only after we managed to attack them. We wonder what would be the case if, instead of taking an offensive attitude, we simply retreat and leave them unattacked.

If they are genetically-programmed for an adaptive response, wouldn't be better to simply retreat till we find a better way to cope with them?

### Information Warfare Gap
There is a great deal of information we are missing about what will be effective in a given setting: underwater combat. The reason is we are already coping with underwater threats from our own planet, and neither we nor the other parties involved are ready to share vital information in order to efficiently neutralize the highly hostile Giselian threat.

### Trust Exploitation
It seems we have simply given up. We do not trust each other, so it seems Giselians know this and exploit this vulnerability against us all.

### Species-Level Conflict
All military conflicts we have known so far were just processes in an ongoing relationship between different groups of the same species: our own species. What we are facing now is a conflict with a different species. Their interests, their goals, their strategies, their motivations, all of it is unknown to us, and if we lack this vital information we become an extremely fragile system.

### Strategic Assessment
Fighting them using our classical military doctrines is bound to fail.
