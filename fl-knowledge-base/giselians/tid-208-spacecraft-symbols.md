## Cultural Design Analysis

### Purposeful Shaping
Obviously the entire spacecraft is purposely shaped according to a culturally dictated plan of which we ignore everything.

### Symbol Classification
Different kinds of symbols, each of them showing different visual properties; we find displays showing:
- Simple bidimensional binary shapes
- Line segments
- Solid shapes  
- Combinations of line segments
- Complex color shapes
- Even more complex sequences of symbols

## Linguistic Analysis

### Statistical Evidence
Bigram conditional entropy analysis and Zipfian statistics both prove that the symbols found in the objects recovered at sensible areas behave like linguistic symbol systems and that the distribution of symbols are not random.

### Missing Element
We may be fighting a losing battle because we are lacking an essential element: the crew. We do not even know if there is a crew at all.

### Interpretation Challenge
The polysemantic nature of the object and the interpretation-making of the viewer are opposed factors.

## Research Limitations

### Secrecy Issues
Keeping all this secret does not help. We need archaeologists, computational linguists, experts in ethnography, people with the necessary skills to interpret objects from other worlds.
