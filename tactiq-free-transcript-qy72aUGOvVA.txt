00:00:00.080 One of Congress's most important responsibilities is oversight of the executive branch in general and the
00:00:05.440 military and intelligence community in particular. Unfortunately, there is a growing body of evidence that the US
00:00:10.960 government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena and that elements
00:00:16.800 within the military and the IC are in violation of their constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.
00:00:27.519 At a congressional hearing on UAPs, independent journalist Michael Shelonburgger submitted a whistleblower
00:00:32.558 report claiming the US government is hiding evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena or UAPs and an alleged secret
00:00:40.000 program called Immaculate Constellation. The report is wild. I'm sure many of you
00:00:46.320 are familiar with it by now, but buried in the pages, something jumped out at me. a name of a website, one I've been
00:00:54.480 following for years, and one that's baffled internet sleuths, linguists, and conspiracy theorists alike, forgotten
00:01:02.239 languages. If you spend any time online looking into forgotten languages, you'll find
00:01:08.080 people calling it one of the deepest rabbit holes on the internet. Some say it's a scop, others think it's a
00:01:13.920 longunning ARG, and some believe it's a genuine research collective just sharing
00:01:19.040 knowledge. Whatever it is, it's pretty massive, really strange, and operating quietly in
00:01:25.280 a corner of the web that most people never see. No mainstream coverage, no clear origin, just a blog that's been
00:01:33.280 quietly publishing strange encrypted articles and eerie videos for nearly two decades.
00:01:39.920 In this video, I'm going to cover the basics. Everything someone new to forgotten languages should know before diving in.
00:01:46.960 And this rabbit hole is deep. There's no way to cover everything in one video. So, think of this as a map, a way to get
00:01:54.079 your bearings, and an introduction to the main players, theories, and terminology before we go further in
00:02:00.159 maybe future episodes if there's enough interest. So, get cozy, grab a snack,
00:02:05.280 and let's start at the beginning. What exactly is forgotten languages?
00:02:14.800 Forgotten
00:02:21.599 Languages or FL is a blog that first appeared in 2005. It's uncertain who
00:02:27.680 started it and when asked, one of the main contributors said, "I do ignore who founded the group as such." The site has
00:02:35.200 published nearly 10,000 posts over the last two decades. No ads, no
00:02:40.560 announcements, no breaks. There are multiple contributors and the number of them has grown from 13 names
00:02:47.440 in 2012 to 43 in 2025. The authors use pseudonyms. Andrew,
00:02:53.440 Darin, Erda. It's rare for a day to pass without at least one new post, but on
00:02:58.560 most days, multiple articles go up. Across a 9-month stretch in 2013 to 2014, they averaged 114 posts per month.
00:03:07.840 Each article includes a title, a block of main text,
00:03:13.519 custom images, the author's name, tags,
00:03:19.440 and a bibliography. The bibliographies often site peer-reviewed papers, other FL articles,
00:03:26.400 and occasionally hidden posts labeled defense reports, entries by FL that are
00:03:31.840 not visible on the public blog. Many of these internal citations follow
00:03:37.440 a specific format L dash and then a number. It's a date, day, month, year.
00:03:44.640 So something like L160706 refers to a post from July 16th, 2006.
00:03:53.680 But some of them site dates long before the site went live in 2008, like this
00:03:58.720 one, which has an article from 98 or decades into the future, like this one,
00:04:05.760 which could be, I guess, 1942, but also 2042 considering the report is about
00:04:11.280 time travel. These anomalies show up most often in defense reports. Many
00:04:17.040 aren't even linked. They just exist in the footnotes, implying a larger archive the public
00:04:23.199 doesn't have access to. Topics covered on the site range from the philosophical
00:04:30.240 to the scientific to just the truly bizarre.
00:04:37.680 Just a glance at the article tags brings up things like alchemy, angelic language, vampier,
00:04:45.280 defense, anti- language, dreams,
00:04:50.400 dark millennium. Many articles reference alien races as
00:04:56.880 well as theoretical tech, language fractals, and what FL calls
00:05:01.919 chemolinguistics, language as a medium for manipulating biology.
00:05:07.600 Most of the articles are written in what look like constructed languages, not foreign languages, but entirely invented
00:05:13.759 ones. Google Translate can't help here, and even advanced AI models can't crack
00:05:19.120 them. They've developed at least 40 of these languages, probably more.
00:05:24.479 One of the most striking examples is Cassini Discus, a symbolic language made up of colored geometric shapes.
00:05:31.440 Sandwiched between the encrypted passages, you'll find English sections. These vary widely. Some read like dense
00:05:38.000 scientific discussions on propulsion or quantum theory. Others are poetry, personal reflections or sharp
00:05:44.720 ideological commentary. Some are possibly the beliefs of FL members themselves. But it's important to point
00:05:51.759 out that many are not. There are quotations from other groups or individuals that don't necessarily
00:05:57.520 reflect the views or beliefs of FL themselves. It's also curious that the site has no
00:06:04.319 obvious monetization or marketing strategy.
00:06:09.440 FL also has a YouTube channel active primarily between 2007 and 2018.
00:06:17.280 The videos feature cryptic visuals layered with electronic music often ambient or techno adjacent and titles
00:06:25.120 that seem just as obscure as the blog posts. As stated by one member of FL, videos in
00:06:32.319 our channel are an alternative way to communicate knowledge. Music is a powerful way to induce altered states of
00:06:38.800 consciousness that sometimes are required to access primordial knowledge.
00:06:45.120 Some viewers have even analyzed the spectrograms of FL's audio tracks, visualizing the frequencies to look for
00:06:51.520 hidden patterns or embedded signals. Then there's the bookstore, Orium
00:06:57.919 Linguay, which advertises rare and esoteric texts. Though many have tried to purchase from the site, decoding its
00:07:04.479 email address and reaching out, no one seems to receive a reply.
00:07:10.000 A note on the site reads, "Please contact us about prices before placing an order for an ondemand book
00:07:15.759 reproduction. Bear in mind that these books are luxury items for wealthy
00:07:21.039 customers." Despite how public the website is, Forgotten Languages remains largely in the shadows, deliberately or
00:07:28.240 otherwise. So, what are these languages and what is this group trying to accomplish?
00:07:38.720 [Music] The most public-f facing figure behind
00:07:45.520 forgotten languages is someone known as Andrrol. Not much is known about them personally, and though many have
00:07:51.440 speculated, their anonymity is intentional. So, this video isn't about doxing anyone, but based on years of
00:07:58.879 forum posts, interviews, and email correspondents, we can start to build a profile. Not of who they are, but what
00:08:05.520 they're about. According to Andrew, the original name of the project was Lingua Obliterata, Latin for eaced or barren
00:08:13.759 languages. Later it became forgotten languages reflecting a broader mission the recovery and evolution of suppressed
00:08:20.639 knowledge. The idea behind FL is to share knowledge. The amount of knowledge
00:08:26.479 currently available on the internet is just a small fraction of the available written knowledge as most of the
00:08:32.240 information remains exclusively on paper in libraries whether public, private or
00:08:37.360 personal. Our mission is to gain access to that knowledge and learn from it. They
00:08:43.039 describe the group as a collection of communities, each focused on a different domain of knowledge. Members are
00:08:48.880 referred to as masters of their domain, and they work together to explore topics ranging from linguistics to physics to
00:08:55.839 metaphysics. Only the masters post, but the communities they lead range from five
00:09:01.120 members to 50. Their focus isn't limited to any one field. You'll find references
00:09:07.040 to everything from sufi mysticism to quantum computing from vetic texts to
00:09:12.880 alleged government black projects. FL doesn't seem to separate esoteric knowledge from classified information.
00:09:19.600 To them both are hidden in plain sight waiting to be discovered. But their main focus language not really as a tool but
00:09:27.680 as a living system. On a language forum in 2010, Andrew stated that language
00:09:33.200 isn't just a way of describing the world. It actually shapes our perception of it. According to them, there are
00:09:40.080 feelings, experiences, and even entire ways of being that only exist because a
00:09:45.360 language gives them form. Only a native speaker of Russian can
00:09:51.200 fully grasp the meaning of dusa. Only a native speaker of Hebrew can grasp the
00:09:56.399 full meaning of mera or ruach. There are cognitive tests that
00:10:01.839 consistently prove a speaker of a certain language perceives reality in a different way than a speaker of another
00:10:07.839 language. Language and consciousness are inseparable. And signs off by calling forgotten
00:10:14.560 languages the translation shall cease project. In Andrew's words, we're
00:10:20.320 reaching a point where existing languages, especially natural ones like English, Russian, or Arabic, are no
00:10:26.640 longer sufficient to describe what's coming. In their view, language shapes not just thought, but identity itself.
00:10:34.000 And that identity can become a prison. Whether it's posthuman evolution,
00:10:39.200 contact with non-human intelligences, or the nature of consciousness itself, we
00:10:44.399 are outgrowing our current vocabulary. To address that, FL claims to have
00:10:50.240 developed a system called node spaces, a kind of experimental software that simulates language drift using
00:10:56.079 mathematical models. They describe it as a genetic algorithm where a language is subjected to evolving boundary
00:11:02.320 conditions. Some languages are the result of altering Welsh or Semitic languages and letting the system run
00:11:08.800 with new parameters. Others, like Cassini Discus, look more like visual symbols than traditional text.
00:11:16.640 We are not interested in proto languages, Angel wrote. We are interested in protohumans as they spoke,
00:11:23.120 so we can understand posthumans as they will speak. These new languages,
00:11:28.560 according to FL, aren't just for communication. They're tools for accessing knowledge, shifting
00:11:33.680 consciousness, and potentially making contact with other forms of life that may exist in extra dimensions.
00:11:42.160 Communication is just a survival strategy used by all life forms. Language is just a small subset used by
00:11:47.839 humans and those life fors who have a similar neural setup.
00:11:53.120 But if we want to communicate with others, say ants, we would need something else entirely. There's a
00:11:59.760 recurring sense in Andrew's writing that the real message isn't just in the words, but in what they point to. that
00:12:06.399 meaning may not come from decoding at all, but from a fundamental shift in how we perceive.
00:12:13.760 The overarching idea is clear. Knowledge is freedom.
00:12:18.880 But maybe it's not the kind of knowledge we're used to chasing. Maybe it's not totally about finding answers, but about
00:12:25.760 learning how to see. And the evolution of language, they believe, is key to accessing knowledge and maybe even kinds
00:12:33.040 of connection that are currently beyond our reach.
00:12:46.800 So, what knowledge are they attempting to communicate? This section is going to
00:12:51.920 briefly describe some of the main topics that FLO covers in their posts. This is by no means a deep dive. So if there's
00:12:58.160 enough interest, future videos will cover each of these topics and more in greater detail.
00:13:10.560 We mentioned note spaces earlier and it's one of the most intriguing claims made by the group. According to Andre,
00:13:16.079 this isn't a language generator per se. It's a framework for simulating language evolution, consciousness drift, and even
00:13:22.880 interspecies communication. Node spaces is often described as a genetic algorithm that applies
00:13:29.200 stochastic boundarydriven changes to natural languages resulting in entirely
00:13:34.240 new linguistic forms. It's not about creating coded languages. The goal is to
00:13:39.680 model the way languages change over time and use that to forecast or simulate how posthuman or non-human entities might
00:13:46.399 communicate. As Andrew put it, we designed a software called nodes spaces
00:13:51.440 that acts as a genetic algorithm that takes as input a given language and then by simulated analing subjects the
00:13:58.560 language to a set of stochastic rules. The language is forced to adapt itself,
00:14:03.760 thus changing its syntactic structure and its morphological internal structure. And to be honest, a lot of
00:14:10.800 this goes over my head. The languages you happen to spot in our vlog are final or intermediate states
00:14:17.120 for given scenarios working on the languages Welsh is called
00:14:23.120 the systemic patterns and let the system evolve
00:14:29.920 assigning specific value to the beta exponent of an icing system to see what happens. language called Lashi 1330 is
00:14:36.399 aicical nouns typology
00:14:42.079 exponent of battery system. So yeah each output is labeled like
00:14:49.920 edag240 or lem 2200 based on the parameters used to generate it. These labels refer to
00:14:57.040 outputs at certain stable attractors within a mathematical model based on the icing model from statistical mechanics.
00:15:04.959 The software they claim is paired with another system called vetorial to simulate these dynamics.
00:15:11.360 The system we are developing is called node spaces and it is coupled to a statistical mechanical program called
00:15:16.560 vetorial. What they do is implement the icing model adapted to the study of language contact and language drift.
00:15:24.800 FL then uses the output of node spaces, these engineered languages for translation experiments, ideological
00:15:30.959 essays, and communication protocols. And they test these languages not by measuring fluency, but by how well they
00:15:37.600 hold up under real world use, like translating sacred texts, philosophical essays, or scientific articles utilizing
00:15:44.880 complex technical jargon. The new language is then used by the community, allowing us to further
00:15:51.040 fine-tune the generated languages, of which so far 37 have been designed, 17
00:15:56.320 of which are now completed. They also emphasize that these are not
00:16:01.360 conlings in the traditional sense. They're meant to model language as an evolving system deeply tied to
00:16:07.440 cognition, memory, and perception. They are also meant to be private.
00:16:12.959 They are not conlangs, which is why we do not pursue research in that area. Because they are engineered, no previous
00:16:18.880 knowledge is available to the non-designers, which allows the languages to be freely used for information sharing and human
00:16:25.199 communication on a private basis. Now, some people online have pointed to a US
00:16:30.240 patent US 66633837B1 filed by object reservoir which was
00:16:36.480 later acquired by Hallebertton as the possible origin or proof of node spaces.
00:16:41.600 This patent is for a symbolic language translator that uses Mathematica to automatically generate simulation code
00:16:47.279 for fluid dynamics models. It's real and pretty complex, but there's ser evidence
00:16:52.639 that it's connected to FL or node spaces in any meaningful way. The system described in the patent uses symbolic
00:16:59.360 manipulation to generate optimized code for modeling fluid flow in porous media like oil reservoirs.
00:17:07.199 patent really has nothing to do with language evolution or symbolic drift. While both systems mention symbolic
00:17:12.799 translation and complex simulation, the goals and implementation are fundamentally different. And maybe it
00:17:18.720 could be applied to language evolution as well. I'm no expert, but I think this connection is probably just a case of
00:17:24.160 thematic similarity and not actual overlap. So, we've talked about the languages.
00:17:30.160 One of the biggest draws for people first encountering forgotten languages is, of course, decrypting them to see what they're hiding. Over the years,
00:17:36.960 independent researchers have uncovered ways to reliably translate some of these languages.
00:17:42.400 A method originally mentioned by a user named the crawler revealed that many of FL's languages aren't purely invented.
00:17:49.440 Instead, they've been relaxified, a linguistic process where the grammar and structure remain largely English, but
00:17:55.840 the vocabulary is replaced with entirely new words. dates, acronyms, punctuation,
00:18:01.440 even proper nouns are often left intact, leaving behind breadcrumbs.
00:18:06.480 In this example, the acronym NAOC has been left in untransated, giving us a
00:18:12.559 clue. The breakthrough came through FL's bibliographies and those untransated
00:18:18.400 clues. By cross- referencing cited sources, especially scientific papers, with blocks of FL's untransated
00:18:24.880 sections, researchers began to identify onetoone matches. These became known as stones.
00:18:31.039 Like Rosetta stones, they unlock parts of a specific dialect and allow translations to be built from the inside
00:18:36.400 out. A sentence like, "Hey, the signal was lost in the storm." Might appear in
00:18:42.320 L asadi up. Same structure, same meaning, same
00:18:49.600 number of words and punctuation, just a different surface. These translations, according to the research community, are
00:18:56.480 often built with substitution tables specific to each dialect and likely processed using software like the now
00:19:02.559 defunct MS transliteration utility. One of the clearest breakdowns of this
00:19:08.320 process comes from a researcher named Kixaru, who details it on their blog, strange minds.au, link in the
00:19:15.039 description. He describes how spreadsheets, Python scripts, and comparison tools are used to build
00:19:20.480 functional dictionaries for many of FL's dialects.
00:19:33.840 One of the most recurring entities mentioned is a group known as the Giselians. Giselian. Giselians.
00:19:40.000 Giselians. Giselians. I don't know. Like almost all of the topics on the blog, giselians aren't introduced with a
00:19:46.480 formal explanation. There's no origin story, no definitive description, just scattered mentions across hundreds of
00:19:52.720 posts. Giselians are consistently associated with highlevel events, UFO
00:19:58.000 sightings, technological anomalies, and direct biological recoveries. According to FL, a site in Galan, Iran referred to
00:20:05.039 as Gazelle, has been at the center of these encounters for over 50 years.
00:20:10.400 You may have heard of the 1976 Thyrron UFO incident. A real widely documented case where two Iranian fighter jets were
00:20:17.600 scrambled to intercept an alleged glowing object in the sky. One jet lost instrumentation and communication as it
00:20:24.240 approached. Weapon systems failed. The radar locked onto something massive. But when the pilot tried to fire, everything
00:20:30.720 shut down. Suddenly, nothing was working. The weapons control panel was out. And I
00:20:36.480 lost all the instruments and the radio. Jafari looked to his left and saw the
00:20:42.320 primary diamond-shaped thing up there and another bright object came out of it and headed directly to the ground.
00:20:48.480 Expecting an explosion that did not happen, he claimed it seemed to slow down and land gently on the ground,
00:20:54.240 radiating a high bright light. That incident is real. It was reported
00:20:59.840 to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on the same day. In a post titled 64 years of
00:21:05.280 excavations in Gazelle, FLEL claims that what happened in 1976 was part of a broader recovery effort related to
00:21:12.159 Cassellian technology and biology. That GEL is somehow a hot spot for out
00:21:18.240 of Earth visitors is out of dispute. The 1976 Terron UFO incident was probably
00:21:23.520 the tip of the iceberg. They alleged that two earlier highlevel events in 1975 and 1976 which were never
00:21:31.440 publicly disclosed prompted the formation of an international recovery program and a later incident. The 2003
00:21:38.960 highle event involved the recovery of the downed craft from the depths of the Caspian Sea. An opportunity to gather
00:21:45.360 information on the biology of those beings. FL reports the recovery of five nearly
00:21:51.200 intact bodies and non-aterrestrial artifacts, including some linked to the enigmatic Cassini discus system. The
00:21:58.960 implication is that the Gelians, who are never clearly defined, aren't just passing through. They may have lost
00:22:05.200 something here, and they may be trying to get it back. Some of the bodies found in the Gassel
00:22:10.559 site deserve special mention for the pattern of disposal as well as for the association with strange technological
00:22:16.320 objects in particular with the so-called Cassini discus. The 1976 incident itself according to FL
00:22:24.720 was part of a larger wave of Gelian activity including events in Spain, Iran, and elsewhere that year. Referred
00:22:32.240 to it as the Gellian forward wave. Of all the UFO flaps, this was the most
00:22:37.679 extraordinary as Gazelian visitors ventured to even land on at least three occasions and were reported to fly over
00:22:44.400 35 sensitive military facilities. They describe a sophisticated intelligence gathering operation,
00:22:51.039 sightings over nuclear and military sites, and intercepted signals that couldn't be identified or denied.
00:22:58.240 It remains unexplained how multiple 121.12 mehertz signals were received as
00:23:04.880 if the ground were covered with hundreds of emergency beacons. They also report radiation-like injuries
00:23:11.760 reported by recovery personnel. Two of the recovery team members felt a burning in the chest, having a total loss of
00:23:18.320 epidermis. Three died on the morning of the 5th. The official line was denial.
00:23:23.600 According to FL, there were even international meetings between Soviet and American officials to withhold what
00:23:29.200 happened in Gazelle from the Iranian government. Decision on not to share any information about the Gazelle incident
00:23:35.520 with the Iranians. Reply from the Soviets that they will not share with us any information
00:23:40.559 related to the Gassel highle events if Balenko's affair is not properly handled.
00:23:46.400 Even more unsettling is the idea that these beings weren't necessarily trying to communicate with us at all. In
00:23:52.000 another post, FL describes the CAFB incident in New Mexico where signal exchanges were reportedly observed
00:23:58.320 between non-human life forms with us on the outside simply watching.
00:24:03.520 We were contemplating the signs of unintentional communication between non-human life forms absolutely not
00:24:09.919 interested in communicating with us. FL calls this a shift from semiodics,
00:24:15.919 the study of meaning, to seiosis, the process by which meaning itself emerges.
00:24:21.360 To them, these aren't just aliens and ships. They are part of our world, part of our technosphere, and now our
00:24:28.000 biosemiosphere. They've left markers, signals, beacons
00:24:34.880 from Iran to Kamaka, Chiapas to Alaska.
00:24:42.080 And if FL is to be believed or the sources they're quoting, we're not looking for them anymore and haven't
00:24:48.400 been for a long time. We've been living alongside them.
00:25:03.120 If you've ever seen videos of glowing orbs zigzagging across the sky, splitting apart, fusing, or vanishing,
00:25:09.200 FL might argue you were not witnessing a UFO. You were watching a mill orb.
00:25:15.679 According to FL sources, millorbs, short for military orbs, are spherical plasmoids designed for electronic
00:25:22.400 warfare, population influence, and even pilot training. They're not alien, but they're not exactly human either.
00:25:28.400 They're something new. In the post, From radar angels to optical demons, FL
00:25:33.919 describes them as glowing greenish spheres made of phosphorescent materials designed to mimic the full
00:25:39.120 electromagnetic and visual signature of an aircraft. For a casual observer, the millorb
00:25:45.679 appears just like that, a greenish glowing sphere. But when switched into the kinetic mode, it looks like a green
00:25:52.240 bluish rod falling from the sky toward the selected target at high speed.
00:25:58.080 They're part decoy, part weapon, and part psychological warfare. In another
00:26:03.520 article, FL claims that PSVs, or paradigm shifter vehicles, were designed to transcend the pilot aircraft
00:26:10.240 relationship entirely. The pilot then becomes a wearable embedded into a smart object fully
00:26:17.120 controlled by bio signals. From the outside, what you observe is just a black triangle which behaves as a living
00:26:22.720 form. These vehicles use emotion sensors, retinal scanning, and neural response
00:26:28.960 data to form a kind of hybrid consciousness between pilot and machine. According to FL, the pilot is no longer
00:26:35.840 human in the traditional sense. They're tweaked, neurologically adapted for full
00:26:41.919 cybernetic integration. Some PSVs, like the presence vehicle,
00:26:47.840 are reportedly invisible to radar during testing and only become visible once the mission calls for it. QAZ and FTW radars
00:26:56.080 were blind to the test vehicle for at least 23 minutes. Test flight shows the vehicle could have easily disrupted all
00:27:02.640 major radar facilities. But it's not just about stealth or speed. Some PSVs FL claims are designed
00:27:10.640 to specifically induce mystical experiences in those who see them. Whether that's awe, confusion, or a
00:27:17.039 complete spiritual shift. After being exposed to the PSV vehicles, individuals
00:27:22.559 suffer a change in attitude towards death. Consciousness is understood as separate from bodily incarnations.
00:27:30.320 One test flight they say was responsible for the infamous Phoenix Lights event. This isn't only advanced aerospace tech.
00:27:37.120 It's narrative control. And according to FL, these crafts serve a double duty.
00:27:43.120 They're used to test enemy airspace defenses and also to train our own pilots without them even knowing it.
00:27:49.360 Millorbs are deployed during live exercises and pilots are never told that they were being tested. See, taking a
00:27:55.679 UFO for an incoming missile is okay with us. Taking an incoming missile for a UFO
00:28:00.799 is not. So if a pilot sees a millorb, reacts, and reports it as a UFO, that's
00:28:06.159 considered a successful test. Telling them the UFOs they encounter are millorbs used to test their combat
00:28:12.399 abilities will destroy the spirit of the advanced training program. On the other hand, not telling them the truth
00:28:17.679 bolsters their belief in the existence of UFOs. The very moment they know that we have the capability to recreate UFO
00:28:24.159 sightings, that will become box populi and hence the entire training program will be ruined.
00:28:30.640 Some millorbs are even said to be capable of penetrating walls, regenerating on the other side and
00:28:35.679 absorbing radar energy to stay alive.
00:28:41.039 The more you track the object with radar, the longer its lifetime. In the absence of an RF source, the PSV
00:28:47.120 provides the millorb with the required RF. So, no, it is not a PSV chasing a millorb that you see. It is a PSV
00:28:54.640 feeding millorb. And then there's the big one. Tic tacs.
00:29:00.159 While most people know them from the USS Nimmits encounter, FL makes a bold claim.
00:29:05.919 Tic Tac UFOs? No, sorry. They are kinetic weapons at hypersonic speeds.
00:29:11.600 After impact, the smallest piece you'd find is the size of a tic tac mint.
00:29:16.960 They're launched from vehicles like Sienna and Tangent. And FL says even Carrier Strike Group 11 didn't detect
00:29:23.279 them because they weren't looking under the sea. They were looking up
00:29:37.840 throughout the English passages in FL. A group called SV17Q shows up again and again. sometimes
00:29:45.440 mentioned directly and sometimes just hinted at. When they appear, the tone changes. These aren't researchers or
00:29:52.399 scientists explaining their work. They sound like strategists, cold, calculated, and in control. It feels
00:29:59.760 less like academic writing and more like internal communications from people pulling strings behind the scenes
00:30:06.159 economically, politically, and globally. In one article, they described their
00:30:11.840 philosophy bluntly. If UAP are a threat to any states, then they are probably a
00:30:17.120 threat to all. Collective security is the most logical defense. Thus, SV17Q
00:30:22.559 backed a strategy of attacks to key infrastructures all over the world to force a situation in which the entire
00:30:29.200 world would accept collective security. It reads like the justification of a
00:30:34.640 covert elite, one that doesn't only react to world events, but manipulates them. And not for governments, but for
00:30:40.799 markets. Disclosure does not depend on governments. It depends on us, the
00:30:46.080 market. UAP represent a golden opportunity to increase our profits if we manage the situation wisely.
00:30:53.520 In one document, SV7Q is directly linked to covert military actions. The article
00:30:59.120 Zafar-1 satellite beautiful failure describes a 2020 operation where SV17Q
00:31:05.279 conducted cyber and physical disruptions during tensions between the US and Iran. It involved communication blackouts, the
00:31:12.320 interception of satellite parts, and the deployment of millorbs. In the article, Super Games, FL presents CO 19 not as a
00:31:20.080 health crisis, but as a coalition strategic game. Dates, economic metrics, and even lab incidents are presented in
00:31:27.520 eerie sequence, like a multiplayer simulation being run by competing factions. One of those players, SV7Q.
00:31:34.960 Another group, SV06N, is also mentioned, allegedly running a boweapon test in a
00:31:40.559 US retirement community. Then we hit realworld overlap. As mentioned at the
00:31:46.000 beginning of this video, journalist Michael Shelonburgger submitted a whistleblower report to Congress that among other claims mentions forgotten
00:31:52.559 languages. Buried in the dense testimony is this. The National Underwater Reconnaissance Office or NEURO collects
00:31:59.519 massent data on underwater UAP and seeks but is unable to coordinate with a group
00:32:05.120 known as SV17Q. For a great video on neuro, check out UAP Gerb's video, link in the
00:32:11.840 description. We now know that this document was provided by former Pentagon and State Department whistleblower
00:32:17.919 Matthew Brown. In his interview with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, he hinted at the existence
00:32:24.159 of a global group operating behind the scenes, an elite network responsible for a system of secrecy that has infiltrated
00:32:30.640 and compromised key parts of society for the benefit of a select few. According to him, the military, intelligence
00:32:36.880 agencies, academic institutions, and scientific fields have all been entangled in this hidden agenda. He
00:32:43.120 portrays the United States as having willingly allowed itself to be influenced by a force that treats
00:32:48.159 countries and people as mere instruments to achieve its objectives. Could he be referring to SV17Q?
00:32:57.760 In the same FL article that the Shelonburgger document references, SV7Q is again connected to a database called
00:33:03.919 Dolan, which allegedly tracks 17,500 signatures, including non-aterrestrial
00:33:09.279 ones. The article claims SV17Q confiscates the data under a no right to
00:33:15.120 know dictim. We don't know who SV17Q actually is, but on Discord, a user who
00:33:21.679 met Lou Alzando, former head of the Pentagon's ATIP program, claims Lou told them that SV7Q and SV06N are real and
00:33:30.799 that they were real bodies. Take that how you will. Alzando has stirred
00:33:35.919 controversy recently after showing a debunked photo of a supposed UFO at a congressional meeting. One quickly
00:33:41.679 revealed to be an optical illusion created by Fields. So maybe treat his name with caution. But the mention of
00:33:48.960 SV7Q is certainly now bleeding from obscure FL documents into the larger UAP
00:33:54.480 conversation.
00:34:03.190 [Music] These are just a few of the names and themes that show up through the
00:34:08.719 forgotten languages archive. There are dozens more cryptic ones like LIAV,
00:34:14.639 XVIS, Dolan, which we mentioned earlier, Noria,
00:34:20.560 the Queltron machine, Cassini Discus, which we discussed briefly, and the
00:34:26.960 Nebian probes among others. whole systems of thought and symbolic language scattered like breadcrumbs
00:34:33.679 across their almost 10,000 posts. I've literally only scratched the surface here. Each of these topics really
00:34:40.000 deserves its own deep dive. And again, if there's enough interest, that's what future videos will explore. For now, if
00:34:46.639 you're feeling overwhelmed, that's okay. It's to be expected. This isn't really a rabbit hole meant to be mastered or
00:34:53.280 solved. It's just one you kind of learn to live with. Mystery is part of the fun for me anyway. So, we still haven't
00:35:00.079 really answered the question, what is forgotten languages. It's a question with a lot of theories
00:35:05.280 and basically no answers. But to understand what this project might be, we need to look at a few of the most
00:35:10.960 common explanations and what evidence supports or challenges each one.
00:35:16.480 At first glance, Forgotten Languages fits the mold of an alternate reality game or ARG. There are strange
00:35:22.800 languages, encrypted posts, and cryptic connections to realworld events. Some of
00:35:27.920 the English passages even read like narrative monologues, while the rest of the site is buried under ciphers and
00:35:32.960 invented grammars. For someone stumbling onto the blog, it might feel like a puzzle waiting to be solved. But if this
00:35:40.720 is a game, it's one without rules, rewards, or clear players. There are no
00:35:46.880 leaderboards, no community updates, no winking clues to reassure the audience that it's all pretend. Most ARGs are
00:35:54.400 designed to be solved, but FL resists solving. It's recursive, massive, and
00:36:00.560 largely uninterested in engaging directly with the outside world. There's also longevity to consider. Blog has
00:36:07.119 been updated almost daily for over 15 years with thousands of articles. That's a level of commitment that goes far
00:36:13.119 beyond what most ARGs aim for. And there's no monetization, no apparent audience engagement, just an unrelenting
00:36:20.560 stream of content. Remember the bookstore I mentioned? You used to be able to buy them and some of them were
00:36:26.480 quite expensive, but the buy links are gone now. They cut off a clear way of
00:36:32.240 making money. It could be a long form LAR, sure, but
00:36:37.520 if it is, it's one of the most sustained, detailed, and inaccessible ones ever made.
00:36:44.079 Some of the terminology in FL points directly to defense contexts, defense reports, elint, ISR, node spaces, mass
00:36:52.560 and more. Blog references real locations, real satellites, and real military programs. It even aligns with
00:36:59.760 dates of public events like the previously mentioned Tan UFO incident, the Phoenix Lights, and specific
00:37:05.680 satellite re-entries. One theory suggests FL is a kind of narrative training ground, a soft
00:37:11.920 interface for internal communication, scenario modeling, or testing psychological responses to disclosure
00:37:18.560 themes. The blog's languages could function as obfuscation, methods of hiding meaning in plain sight while
00:37:24.960 still offering accessibility to trained eyes. Or they could be modeling a technology they'd like to sell to
00:37:31.359 defense contractors or the government. But there are issues with this theory.
00:37:37.040 For one, the blog is public. If it were truly a covert government project, why hosted on an open access platform with
00:37:43.359 no login or clearance barriers? Government ops don't tend to wrap intelligence in postmodern poetry and
00:37:49.520 fedic symbolism. Still, some researchers think that it could be a leaked archive,
00:37:54.960 a back channel, or a legacy project from a now defunct unit. There are hints, but
00:38:00.160 no confirmation. This is my personal favorite. Forgotten Languages shares conceptual DNA with the
00:38:06.960 Cybernetic Culture Research Unit or CCRU, a 1990s collective that merged
00:38:12.640 philosophy, cybernetics, occult ideas, and speculative fiction into recursive
00:38:17.680 theoretical experiments. CCRU developed the idea of hyperstition,
00:38:23.200 fictions that make themselves real by spreading, repeating, and embedding in culture.
00:38:29.119 FL seems to operate in a similar way. Its articles don't explain, they propagate. It layers myth, math, and
00:38:36.400 metaphor in a way that feels designed to reshape how the reader perceives language, time, and self.
00:38:44.079 In one research paper online, a dedication even thanks members of the CCRU and Andrew Regan in the same space,
00:38:51.359 suggesting at least a shared influence or lineage. If this is a hyperstitutional engine, it
00:38:57.839 may not be trying to describe reality at all. It may be trying to create a new one through language, repetition, and
00:39:04.960 recursion. But unlike the CCRU, FL doesn't seem interested in theory circles, cultural
00:39:11.760 dialogue, or academic discourse. It publishes into a void, refusing
00:39:16.960 commentary or context. So while the structural similarities are strong, the
00:39:22.480 surrounding behavior is a bit harder to place. One of the more unsettling theories is
00:39:28.480 that FL is the mouthpiece of a private non-governmental group operating across defense, finance, and psychological
00:39:35.280 influence domains. This theory hinges on the figure of SV7Q,
00:39:40.720 what we discussed earlier, and a name that appears frequently in English passages with a tone of control and
00:39:46.560 operational authority. Another describes covert cyber operations, directed
00:39:51.839 satellite interceptions, and the deployment of millorbs during real world geopolitical events.
00:39:59.040 If true, this would suggest FL is a place where real world strategies are processed through language for internal
00:40:05.599 use, plausible deniability, or psychological insulation. But again,
00:40:11.520 there's no confirmation. Surface weirdness could be camouflage or it could be exactly what it looks like,
00:40:17.680 speculative fiction dressed in seriousness. Even the Discord claim that Lu Alzando
00:40:23.680 said SV17Q was real, while compelling, is anecdotal and tied to a figure who's
00:40:29.839 recently lost credibility. Sometimes the simplest explanation
00:40:35.359 deserves a hearing. FL could be the work of a passionate, deeply interdisciplinary group,
00:40:42.079 linguists, scientists, artists, maybe a few ex-military types, creating an experimental fusion of fiction,
00:40:49.040 research, and cryptography. Not for fame, not for money, but just for curiosity and art. The use of invented
00:40:57.200 languages, obscure references, and layered meanings might reflect a collective that simply enjoys pushing
00:41:02.560 boundaries. What happens when you treat language like code and code like poetry?
00:41:07.920 What truths hide in metaphor? What futures can you model if you treat myth
00:41:13.040 and math as equal tools? There's a strong case for this. The tone
00:41:19.119 often feels exploratory. There's no attempt to build a brand or sell a worldview. It's just content,
00:41:25.599 voluminous, strange, and consistently produced. The biggest challenge to this theory is
00:41:31.680 scale. nearly 10,000 posts, dozens of languages, years of continuous output.
00:41:39.280 It would require an unusual amount of dedication and some serious technical expertise to sustain something like this
00:41:45.520 for so long. But if FL is a passion project, it's one of the most intricate
00:41:50.880 and expansive ever attempted online.
00:42:02.079 Forgotten Languages, surprisingly, is not just about language. It's about what language hides and how meaning can be
00:42:09.359 buried beneath symbols, systems, and silence. Whether it's ancient texts encoded
00:42:15.520 through forgotten tongues or classified programs obscured by government secrecy, the thread is the same. Knowledge hidden
00:42:22.640 behind a veil. Sometimes to protect, sometimes to obscure, and sometimes
00:42:28.400 simply because we've forgotten how to see it. FL seems determined to pull that
00:42:33.839 thread. And whether they're revealing truth, encrypting it, or just exploring the limits of language itself, there's
00:42:40.319 no denying that something unusual is happening here. I don't know exactly what forgotten
00:42:47.040 languages is. But something about it keeps drawing me back.
00:42:52.480 Maybe it's not meant to be solved. Maybe it's something to sit with, like a
00:42:57.599 symbol or a dream. Something that shapes you more than you shape it. And I'm not
00:43:04.400 here to decode it, just to share what I found and open space for others who are curious, too. Of course, this video
00:43:11.839 barely scratches the surface. There's a lot I didn't include. Whole systems, deep lore, obscure terms, and countless
00:43:18.720 theories. Some of you who have been following FL for years might wish I'd gone deeper or mentioned other topics.
00:43:25.200 And I get it. But this was meant to give a wide angle view, a kind of orientation for anyone
00:43:32.319 encountering forgotten languages for the first time. That way, if we do dive in to the specifics later, the bigger
00:43:38.720 picture is already there. And there really is so much more to explore, not just in FL itself, but in the
00:43:45.040 communities that have risen and fallen trying to understand it. From the legendary forgotten languages study
00:43:50.400 group F LSG to the Discord server I'm part of now filled with people still chasing the signal. There are mysterious
00:43:57.359 figures, strange events, fully translated articles, and tons of unanswered questions, not just in the
00:44:03.680 material, but in the people who've tried to make sense of it. And then there's my own personal interactions with members
00:44:10.000 of FL. If there is enough interest in future videos, I'll be diving deeper
00:44:15.040 into the themes we touched on and more. Not because I have any answers, but because these questions feel alive to
00:44:22.880 me. And if you have a particular question you want me to explore or something you feel I brushed over too
00:44:29.200 quickly in this video, please leave a comment. I would love the feedback. If something here struck a chord or stirred
00:44:35.680 a question, stick around. I'm going to keep following the thread wherever it leads, and you're more than welcome to
00:44:42.400 come along. Thanks for watching.
